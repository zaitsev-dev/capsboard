# ⚙️ CapsBoard

**CapsBoard** is a small AutoHotkey script that allows you to switch your keyboard layout using the **CapsLock** key on **Windows**.

> 🧪 Tested on **Windows 11**. Compatibility with other versions is unconfirmed.


## 🚀 How to Use

1. 📦 Download the pre-compiled executable from release page: `capsboard.exe`
2. 📁 (Optional) Move the file to a safe location so it won’t be deleted accidentally
3. ▶️ Run the `.exe` file as usual
4. 📌 Look for the CapsBoard icon in your system tray
5. 🖱️ Right-click the tray icon to open options
6. 🔁 (Optional) Set the script to run at Windows startup
7. ❌ Exit the script by right-clicking the icon and selecting **Exit**


## 🐞 Known Bugs

- Switching doesn't work when focus is on the **taskbar** or **system windows**, such as UAC prompts or dialogs requiring administrative privileges

## 📝 Notes

- You can still toggle CapsLock in combination with other keys as usual. For example, `Shift + CapsLock` or `Ctrl + CapsLock` will behave the same way as `CapsLock` does when the script is not running.
- The project icon was generated using the free version of ChatGPT.
